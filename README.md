Cortijo Cost Management System

This repository contains a Python-based cost management system for a property, referred to as "Cortijo". This system models the property and its associated entities as objects and utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to manage and calculate costs associated with the property. The system can also visualize the structure of the property and its entities as a graph using NetworkX and PyGraphviz libraries.
Classes

    Cortijo: Represents the property. It has attributes such as name and children to store the associated entities.

    CortijoChild and CortijoGrandChild: These classes represent the different entities associated with the property. They also have name and children attributes.

    Cost: Represents the different types of costs associated with each entity in the system. It can add, remove, modify and calculate total costs.

    Graph: Represents the property and its entities as a directed graph. It can draw the graph, which can then be saved as a PNG file or rendered to an in-memory image.

Usage

Here is a basic example of using these classes:

from estates import Cortijo
from structures import Building
from zones import Room
from helper import GeoPoint

from grapher import Graph
from ressources_finance import Cost
from storage import create_file, save_object, load_object

# set project dir and name
project_dir = 'data/'
filename = 'LosCigarrones_v1'
full_path = create_file(project_dir, filename)

cortijo = Cortijo()
cortijo.name = 'Los Cigarrones, Orgiva'
cortijo.landSize = 1900        # m^2
cortijo.location = GeoPoint(
    36.886978,                 # latitude
    -3.379498,                 # longitude
    400)                       # elevation
# adding costs
cortijo.add_cost('purchase', 75000)     # â‚¬
# display the properties of the Corijo
cortijo.display()
cortijo.display_missing()

# define the house
stoneHouse = Building()
stoneHouse.name = 'stoneHouse'
stoneHouse.houseSize = 54 # m^2
stoneHouse.add_child('rooms', [
    Room('kitchen'),
    Room('living room'),
    Room('private bedroom')
])
# adding costs
stoneHouse.add_cost('restoration', 5000)
# display the properties of the house
stoneHouse.display()
stoneHouse.display_missing()

# add the house to the Cortijo
cortijo.add_child('structures', [stoneHouse]

# draw a graph of all objects
graph_cortijo = Graph(cortijo)])
graph_cortijo.draw_graph(full_path, save=1)
# save project
save_object(cortijo, "data.pkl", full_path)

This example creates a property with one house, assigns some costs to the property and the house, calculates the total costs, and creates a graph of the property.
